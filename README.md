- Run `cargo build --release` to compile the project. This command compiles the project in release mode, optimizing the binary for performance.

### 5. Run the Node
- After building, you can start a Kari chain node using `cargo run --release`. This command runs the compiled project.
- Depending on the project's specifics, you might need to add additional flags or configuration files to successfully start a node.

### 6. Interact with the Kari Chain
